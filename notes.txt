A very simple The Binding of Isaac clone.

The main picture is to have rooms and floors.
Each floor has a random number of rooms (with edge cases of course for
a minimum number and a maximum).
Floors are generated randomly by inserting rooms of different kinds
(treasure, shop, challenge), which will be connected by doors.

The floor layout and topology should be a graph type of structure,
meaning that they can be cyclic and traversed back and forth.
the boss room should be the last one generated which only has 1 way to enter
1 way to exit.

It is unlocked by default.

Each room is also procedurally generated, with platforms and pits.

The rooms are made of tiles, each tile can be either empty or full.
Empty tiles can be traversed only if fly is activated.

The full tiles must trace a path to each door the room has.

There cannot be floating full tiles not connected to the others.

Full tiles cannot be connected only on the edge.

Flying enemies can spawn everywhere, meanwhile walking ones only on full tiles.

Once you clear a room you are presented with a reward, which can be a coin/bomb/key, or an item.

The player (Isaac) can have coins, bombs and keys.
The player can obtain and store an infinite number of items which are from 2 categories:
	- passive
	- active
	- consumables

Each item changes a stat, or has special behaviour that affects isaac/the current game.

Each game consists of 3 floors, each one has a different sprite design and a different enemy pool.

Once you reach the last boss (3rd) you are presented with the last boss in the "last floor" which is a special floor
since it has only 1 room, with the boss.

There are different types of rooms:
	- treasure (1 or more free items)
	- shop (some items which you can buy with coins)
	- challenge (decide to activate a challenge in the room to
                     get an item as a reward, the challenge consists of many different enemies
                     or a boss)

Isaac has many stats:
	- Health containers (It can have up to 8 containers and 8 hearths total too)
	- Current hearts (every type of heart the player currently holds, in order)
	- Strength (base damage to enemies)
	- Movement speed
	- Projectile speed
	- Projectile range
	- Luck (to find better items)
	- Shoot speed (how many projectiles per second)

Hearts can be of different kinds:
	- Red hearts (fills hearth containers)
	- Blue hearts (do not need a hearth cointainer)
	- Black hearts (deal a little damage to every enemy in the room
                        when destroyed)

Pills are consumables which do any kind of effect, from stats to player appearance
to any kind of different behaviour.
